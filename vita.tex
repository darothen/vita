\mhead{Research \newline Interests}

As a leader and innovator in the atmospheric sciences, I've employed novel
analytical, modeling, "big data", and machine learning techniques to help
pioneer the field of "atmospheric data science" and tackle cutting-edge
research questions in the world of weather and climate. In my academic 
career I studied the multi-faceted role of aerosols in the climate system,
especially their influences on clouds and their indirect effects on climate;
I've also studied the role of climate variability in driving air quality 
as a means for better understanding the impacts of climate air pollution 
policy. \\ \\
Throughout my research career I've been committed to helping develop open 
source software and tools in order to support novel applications of machine
learning and data science to understanding and solving problems in meteorology.
I've also strived to form a robust community of scientists, data scientists,
and engineers who would also support these initiatives and themselves 
contribute to open science.
