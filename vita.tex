\mhead{Research \newline Interests}

My research focuses on the multi-faceted role of aerosols in the climate system, particularly their influences on clouds and indirect effects on climate. I am also interested in climate variability, air quality, policy, and ``big data'' issues in the geosciences including the design and construction of open source software and tools to support novel applications of machine learning and data science to the modeling and analysis of atmospheric and climatic phenomena.
