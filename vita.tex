\mhead{Professional \newline Interests}

I endeavor to serve as a leader in the weather and climate informatics communities,
working to advance the application of new technologies to solve classing problems
in our field. Most recently, these include the development of AI and ML tools which
might rapidly advance weather forecasting capabilities, and the curation of data and
infrastructure which best enable the community to leverage this technology.
